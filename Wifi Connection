# Connect to Wi-Fi Using Terminal

## 1. Turn on WiFi (Radio)

```bash
nmcli radio wifi on
```

This command enables the Wi-Fi radio, allowing your system to detect and connect to networks.

---

## 2. Check WiFi Status

```bash
nmcli radio
```

This shows whether Wi-Fi is enabled:

- `enabled` = working  
- `disabled` = turned off (soft block or hardware switch off)

---

## 3. Check WiFi Interface

```bash
nmcli device
```

Example output:
```
wlp1s0   wifi   disconnected  --  
```

- Your output may look slightly different.  
- This shows the wireless device name (`wlp1s0`) and its current state (e.g., `disconnected` if not yet connected).

---

## 4. Scan for Available WiFi Networks

```bash
nmcli device wifi list
```

This scans nearby networks and shows:

- **SSID** (network name)  
- **Signal strength**  
- **Security type** (e.g., WPA2)

---

## 5. Connect to a WiFi Network

```bash
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "your_password"
```

**Example:**

```bash
nmcli device wifi connect "CSG-3a6f" password "fcf9a274"
```

This connects to the network and automatically saves the connection for future use.

> ðŸ”¸ If the SSID has spaces, wrap it in quotes like "My Home Wifi"

---

## 6. Check Active Connection

```bash
nmcli connection show --active
```

This confirms your connection and shows the interface used (e.g., `wlp1s0`).

---

## 7. Get Your IP Address

```bash
ip a
```

Look under the `wlp1s0` section for your IP address (usually starts with `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x`).
